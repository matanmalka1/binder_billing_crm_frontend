## Scope Locked

Sprint 3 frontend scope is locked to:
- Binder operational actions (`receive`, `ready`, `return`) via backend endpoints
- Client operational actions (`freeze`, `activate`) via backend endpoints
- Dashboard quick action surface and attention indicators (render-only)
- Rendering of backend-derived `work_state`, `signals`, and `sla_state`
- UI primitives: `Modal`, `ConfirmDialog`, `ActionButton`
- Hebrew-only UI with RTL layout and no client-side business logic
